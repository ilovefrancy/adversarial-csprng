# Protecting Communications with Adversarial Neural Cryptography

This project seeks to reimplement, and possibly improve, the generative
adversarial network built by researchers at Google Brain, and outlined in
the paper [Learning to Protect Communications
with Adversarial Neural Cryptography](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06918).


## How the Reference Implementation Works
