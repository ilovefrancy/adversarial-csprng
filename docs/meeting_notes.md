# MEETING NOTES
Discussion points for weekly meeting with supervisors.


## 1 - PAPERS

1.  **Next bit test is theoretical** (it is expressed in terms of "all possible
    polynomial-time algorithms"). If a CSPRNG can be shown to pass the next-bit
    test we know the output also passes statistical tests for randomness, but
    algorithmically showing proof of passing the theoretical test is unfeasible.
2.  The **Sadeghiyan-Mohajeri test** builds a "pattern tree" of an input, and
    using that tree, computes the probability of predicting the next bit in the
    pattern at any point.
