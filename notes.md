# NOTES

## Options for adversarial scheme

1.  Generate one binary sequence, predict single next bit
  1.  Is this test trivial because it's 1/2 chance?
2.  Generate one binary sequence, classify as random or not
  1. How do we perform this test?
3.  Generate one binary sequence, discriminator outputs double between 0 and 1
    representing how sure it is of whether the sample is random or not
